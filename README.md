CWSmartObject
=============

Allows you to create objects from dictionaries and just handles a bunch of other annoying tasks. Inspired by code that I wrote while still at Sqwiggle. CWSmartObject is derieved from [SQObject.{h,m} in the Sqwiggle iOS SDK](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ios-sdk/blob/master/iOSSDK/SQObject.h)

How to Install
--------------
Add <code>pod 'CWSmartObject'</code> to your podfile, then import <code><CWSmartObject/CWSmartObject.h></code>.

ToDo: 
-----
- Examples!
- Tests!
